RomantiqueInitials

The upper and lower case of each character can be combined to form a two-color character.

The space is exactly one-half the width of any of the initials.

The letterforms themselves were created from scanned images of a graphic alphabet designed by Aridi. The originals, in full color .eps and .bmp, are available from Aridi.
