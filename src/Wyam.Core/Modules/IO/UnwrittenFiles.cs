    /// This module is useful for eliminating documents from the pipeline on subsequent runs depending

    /// use this module if you're sure that no other pipelines rely on the output documents</strong>. Because 
    /// this module removes documents from the pipeline, those documents will never reach the 
    /// end of the pipeline and any other modules or pages that rely on them (for example, an 
    /// image directory) will not be correct.
